/**
 * Desktop PlaylistStorage: no SAF/MediaStore concept exists here, so `rootDir` plays the role
 * Android's fixed "Playlists" folder does - `playlistDirName` is a bare folder name resolved
 * against it. This matters because Playlist.kt's own createFromDisk (synced verbatim from
 * Android) always reduces its `fullPlaylistFolder` argument down to a bare last-path-segment
 * name before calling listJpegs/getPlaylistType, mirroring Android's bare-name-relative-to-root
 * model - so those two methods can't just treat their argument as an already-absolute path.
